      "description": "I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in designing, developing, and delivering robust backend systems using the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. My expertise lies in building scalable, high-performance applications across diverse domains such as Private Equity, Healthcare, and Innovation Platforms.\n\nI specialize in C#, ASP.NET Core, RESTful APIs, microservices architecture, and database design using SQL Server. My work is driven by principles of clean architecture, testability, and long-term maintainability. I've led complex technical projects, ensuring they align with business goals, meet security and performance standards, and scale effectively.\n\nHolding a PMP certification, I have successfully managed and delivered agile-based projects, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and led development efforts across distributed environments. I believe that effective communication and structured leadership are just as critical as technical execution.\n\nCurrently, I'm expanding my skillset in Artificial Intelligence and DevOps. I'm actively integrating AI into backend systems, and adopting modern DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud-native deployments.\n\nBeyond the code, I'm passionate about mentorship, community building, and simplifying complex topics through education. Whether I'm designing a system or leading a team, I aim to drive value, inspire growth, and push the boundaries of what's possible with software."
